        <p class="p2">wealthyvision has started out making beats from an ipad using an app called the iMPC. He has a huge interest in sampling and has made quite compelling beats using this method. his recent EP 'Hard Work Pays Off' is a reflection of the hard work that he has put in for a short period of time on an amazing body of work. Wealthyvision isn't seeing the amount of love due to lack of publicity but taking a look on his <a href="http://soundcloud.com/wealthyvision" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a> would make all of the difference. He has a team of producers by his side to help aid him in where he wants to take his musical imagination.</p>
